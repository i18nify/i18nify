## 🔧 Ways to Contribute

### 🐛 Bug Reports
If something isn't working as expected:

- First, check the [Issues](https://github.com/i18nify/i18nify/issues) to see if it’s already reported.
- If not, create a new issue with:
  - A clear title
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Screenshots or error messages

### 💡 Feature Requests
We’re constantly improving. Suggest enhancements or new capabilities:

- Use the [Discussions](https://github.com/i18nify/i18nify/discussions/categories/ideas) tab to share your thoughts.
- Prefer use-case-driven suggestions, not just technical ideas.

### 🖋️ Documentation Improvements
Found a typo? Want to clarify a section of the README?

- Fork the repo, edit the Markdown files, and submit a pull request.
- All documentation PRs should target the `main` branch.

### 💻 Code Contributions
While most functionality runs on our platform, we still welcome technical improvements:

- Fix edge cases in transformation logic (e.g. AST rules)
- Propose new text replacement strategies
- Enhance reliability of import injection
- Improve the CLI version (coming soon)

> **Note**: If you’re working on a major feature or refactor, open a discussion or issue first before coding.
